                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The main challenge I had with this lab was learning what jQuery was because 
                   I was not able to attend last lecture. However, by going over the slides And
                   asking my lab partner questions, I was able to figure out how to start coding 
                   with jQuery by adding a dollar sign in front. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="problems">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>One of the problems I had with this lab assignment was trying to understand the 
                   Canvas instructions because I have little knowledge from both working with jquery
                   and also coding in general. So when the instructions told me to add the buttons to 
                   the challenge, problems, and results section of the webpage I didn't know how to 
                   start tackling the question. But with the help of my partner I was able to understand
                   jQuery much more.

            <div id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Slay! You were able to see this, which means the code worked!</p>
            </div>
