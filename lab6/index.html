					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>A challenge I had for this lab was how to create the array on the console. 
					   That's when I double checked with my lab partner and cleared out the intructions
					   on canvas.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that arose as I began the lab were trying to understand the canvas instructions.
					   Some of the instructions felt unclear to me because I am not used to the coding aspect of This
					   course, but I was able to ask my partner to explain how I should structure my console and how the
					   arrays should be written out. Other than that, I was able to look at the screen shots from canvas to 
					   follow along.</p>
