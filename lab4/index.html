			<h1>Lab 4 - Psuedocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Some of the challenges I encountered with this lab assignmnet is knowing how to write psuedocode. This is my first time ever trying to understand how to write psuedocode and writing it for a game. Which I thought would be easy but there are more elements to psuedocode that writing out a to-do list.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problem that I had was trying to figure out the proper psuedocode language for the game I chose. I also did not understand some of the instructions becuase it gave me a template on how to write the psuedocode but because I have never done this before I was pretty lost. That's when I contacted my lab partner to help guide me on what language to use to write psuedocode for my game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this assignment was easier in the way that I did not have to code html or css, so that was nice. However, this lab did touch upoon a new type of coding which I was also unfamiliar with. As with all of my assignments, I put a lot of energy of trying to understand the lab and asked a lot of questions in the process.</p>
