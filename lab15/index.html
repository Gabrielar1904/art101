            <h2>Challenge</h2> 
            <p>One of the main challenges that I had with this lab was the API websites that 
               were given to us on Canvas. I had to double check my work with my partner because
               I was very confused as to why the websites were not working on the console the 
               way that it did for my lab partner. So once I had landed on the starwars API
               it finally worked.</p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>A problem I had in the assignment was that the console was showing a lot of answers from 
               the API websites. Because I am not expert or really understand how the console worked, my
               partner told me that it was because of a section had a lot of code in it that was too much 
               to sort out. So I just had to pick another API website that was better.
