            <h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
            <h2>Challenge</h2> 
            <p>The main challenge I had during this assignment was figuring out the code and 
               the same time understanding the directions of the lab on Canvas. My partner 
               mentioned that the example from Canvas was kind of confusing so then I made 
               sure to double check the lecture slides and also the example my partner did 
               for his lab. 
            </p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>One of the problems I had for this lab was just making sure if I was writing the 
               right coding because even though I attend lecture, it is quite hard to catch up 
               and understand the coding. Thankfully my lab partner really helps with explaining
               the instructions for the lab so I was then able to look up some examples on 
               w3schools and the lecture slides.
