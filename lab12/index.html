            <h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
            <h2>Challenge</h2> 
            <p>I did not have a lot challenges in this lab because the instructions were pretty straight out and 
               pretty easy to understand. It was easy because I was able to pay to take the knowledge from 
               lecture and apply to this lab.</p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>My problems when it comes with coding is that it is very easy for me to mispell something and it 
               effects my code and how the website runs the programming. But other than that I did not have any 
               problems.  </p>
