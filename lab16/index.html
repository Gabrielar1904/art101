            <h2>Challenge</h2> 
            <p>One of the main challenges I had with the lab was being able to know how to append the image
               within the javascript code. However, my partner reminded me that since I had to download the 
               extensions onto chrome that that should be able to fix the problem, and it did!
            </p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>A problem that still seems to be pretty tricky when I do these types of assignments, is that 
               I tend to mispell or miss a symbol when I am coding. It's hard for me to acknowledge what is 
               wrong but being able to double check with the console and my partner helps a lot with being 
               able to fix my mistakes.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Here are the results!</p>
