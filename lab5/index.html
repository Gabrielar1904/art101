					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>A challenge that I had with this lab assignment was understanding if we 
					   needed to use "var" in the console but then my partner it explained it to me. 
					   Other than that, the lab assignmnet so far was pretty easy to understand.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that arose for this lab was trying to understand how to transfer 
					   the console information to Javascript but I double checked with my partner
					   and he told me to simply copy the instructions and the cosole as it was. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>For this lab assignment, I put the same amount of energy as I always do 
					   for all the labs. I made sure to ask questions when I needed and followed 
					   the instructions from canvas. I was able to understand almost all of the 
					   instructions for this assignment which I would consider progress. </p>
