                <p>A Challenge that I encountered on this lab was figuring out how make the input
                   work on my web page. For some reason, everytime I would try to make the input
                   run it was not working. That is when I asked my partner for some help to double 
                   check my work. 
                </p>
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I feel like most of the time I am coding for these lab assignments I find myself
                   always mispelling some part of the code and that effects how the web page runs. 
                   It's always frustrating on my end, but having another pair of eyes on my work 
                   always helps.
