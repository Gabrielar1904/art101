                <h2>Challege</h2>
                <p>A challenge that I encountered during this lab assignment was trying create a new
                   p tag. However, my partner was able to to explain to me the purposes of creating 
                   different variables work. 
                </p>
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>One of the problems that I came across this lab was knowing which CSS elements of 
                   of my web page I would to change. It was hard for me to choose because I never got 
                   to be an expert with CSS coding and knowing how the elemts of the web worked, but 
                   my partner was a big help in guiding me with easier options for elements. Together 
                   we were able to learn to how to put the CSS coding in the Javascript.
