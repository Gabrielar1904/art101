					<p>My partner is super helpful when it comes to answering my questions about lab assignments. Plus, his discord profile picture is fire! He is a second year majoring in Arts & Design: Games & Playable Media, which is such an intersting major! In another life in which I knew how to code, I would have chosen this major as well.</p>
