                <p>My main challenge for this assignment was having to figure out how the variables within the 
                   variables worked. Thankfully my lab partner was able to explain to me that we were just 
                   choosing different math operations and then I understood the lab a lot better. 
                </p>
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>One of the problem I ran into for this lab was knowing which math operation to choose. 
                   And it was a problem that my partner aslo stumbled on, however, he figured out that 
                   by going on w3schools.com, it gives you some operation examples one can try to implement
                   in there Javascript.
                </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Go to the console to see the output!</p>
