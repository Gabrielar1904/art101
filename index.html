					<h2>About Me!</h2>
					<p>Freshman Merrill Affiliate</p>
					<p>Major: BA Sociology and LALS</p>
					<p>Attends the University of California, Santa Cruz
					<p>Hi everyone, am I a first year at UCSC and have always loved art. Ever since I was a kid,
						I would enjoy crafting as much as possible with anything I could find. Over the years,
						I began to take art classes to explore different art mediums. 
						I felt like the classes were nice to know which mediums worked for me and which ones didn't. 
						Then high school began and I started to lose touch with my artistc side. 
						During the pandemic, I realized that making art was a great emotional outlet for me and I 
						began to dabble in line art to break away from the conventional forms of art that made me feel 
						like I had to be a perfectionist and stay within the lines. I like getting to know different forms of art
						and that is why I chose this course. I knew that it would be a challenge since there is a lot of coding 
						involved and because I have absolutely no experience with coding. It is something that will test my limits 
						in a new way, which I am intrested to see turn out. In regards to my major, sociology is another passionate of mine. 
						Coming from a Latinx background and being a first - gen, I have always been curious about the institutions and social
						structures that have impacted me as an individual living in America. I also am very passionate about social justice 
						and love learning about the root cause of current systemic discriminations that minorities experience.</p>
