                <p>Some of the challenges I experieced during this lab was trying to figure out
                   how to create the lab7 folder within the the art101 folder. Everytime I wanted to 
                   add another folder to the lab7 folder I did not go under the folders like the 
                   previous folders. However, with searching how to create folders on the internet and
                   asking my partner I was able to figure out how to add folders
                </p>
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>Some problems that I encountered was being scared of having to do all of the html coding
                   for this lab. However, I was able to use the other labs are a reference to add it to This
                   lab assignment. I also had some trouble being able to do the javascript coding but my partner
                   was able to help me and as well as the instructions on canvas.
                </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>This the end results of my Javascript code:</p>
            <h2>Script Ouput</h2>
                <div class="output">
                    <script src="js/lab.js"></script>
                </div>
